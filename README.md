TwitchPlaysBot
==============

Simple IrcBot that connects to irc.twitch.tv chat and issues key presses based on the chat through Emulator Memory/Registry editing (JNA - works even if emu isn't focused and/or visible) or java Robot class (doesn't work when losing focus on emu window). Best option is to add a module to the emulator program itself (lots of Open Source emu programs available).
